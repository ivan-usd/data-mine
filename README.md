# In the Eye of the Great Resignation: Predicting Churn

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
We will build a classification model that will predict whether or not an employee will leave the company in the next two years based on information such as education level, experience level, tenure, pay, age, gender, and level of company involvement. This model will be used by our client to predict whether or not an employee is planning on leaving the company so that internal HR can intervene in whatever way they see fit.
The purpose of this project is to find a dataset, clean, pre-process it, and perform a data mining project on the data using either R or Python.
